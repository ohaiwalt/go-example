# go-example

This is roughly paraphrased from "Production-Ready Microservices" by Susan Fowler.

## stability

* deployment
* introduction
* deprecation

## reliability

* mitigation of dependency failures

## scalability

* growth scale
* identification of resource bottlenecks
* capacity planning
* scalable handling of traffic
* scaling of dependencies
* scalable data storage

## fault tolerance and catastrophe-preparedness

* single points of failure identified and resolved
* catastrophe and failure scenarios identified and planned for
* failure detection and remediation strategies in place
* tested for resiliency through code, load, and chaos testing
* traffic carefully managed in prep for failure
* incidents and outages handled appropriately and productively

## performance

* appropriate SLAs
* proper task handling and processing
* efficient resource utilization

## monitoring

* proper logging and tracing throughout the stack
* well-designed dashboards that are easy to understand and accurately reflect the health of the service
* effective, actionable alerting accompanied by runbooks

## documentation

* thorough, updated, and centralized documentation containing all of the relevant and essential information about the microservice
